stateless functional component: Generally a presentational component but not always. No access to direct state or lifecycle methods. Generally follows the
const ComponentName = (props, other data) => {
  return (
      <h1>Hello, World</h1>
  )
}

OR 

const ComponentName = (props, other data) => <h1>Hello, World</h1>

THESE ARE THE SAME THING

We would use a functional component because it is less code to render by the browser and we don't need state or lifecylce methods

Higher Order Components: If you find yourself rebuilding a lot of logic or having your components share a lot of functionality you should look to use a Higher Order Component. It is NOT ACTUALLY A COMPONENT but a function that returns a new component.

Render Props: Anything a Higher Order Component can do, a render prop can do. Generally easier to reason with. Is literally a prop called render on the Component but doesn't need to be called render

PropTypes: A way to set a specific type (array, function, string, boolean etc.) on a components props. Only shows warning ind development mode
